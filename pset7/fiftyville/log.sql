-- Keep a log of any SQL queries you execute as you solve the mystery.

-- 1. Get the detail from the crime scene report
SELECT description FROM crime_scene_reports
WHERE
    year = 2020 AND

    street = 'Chamberlin Street';
-- description
-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
-- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.


--2.  According to the report, there were 3 witnesses with some transcripts worth further investigations.
SELECT name, transcript FROM interviews
WHERE
    year = 2020 AND
    month = 7 AND
    day = 28 AND
    transcript LIKE '%courthouse%';

-- name | transcript
-- Ruth | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
-- Eugene | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.


-- Ruth & Eugene & Raymond's transcripts possibly implies the following behaviors of the thief and accomplice (chronologically):
-- 1. The thief withdraw money from ATM on Fifer Street (2020.07.28 early morning)
-- 2. The thief took a phone call to his/her accomplice for less than a minute (2020.07.28 before leaving courthouse)
-- 3. The thief drove a car away from the courthouse parking lot (2020.07.28 10:15~10:25)
-- 4. The thief took the earliest fight out of Fiftyville on July 29th

-- So we will investigate and build SQL query based on the conditions
